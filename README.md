These changes are now integrated into the Cozy Weather GitHub by 5/8.  The functionality may be released later by the author of the package.

To use this mini-package as a stop-gap, just add the CozyWeatherSceneController to the just about any gameObject that persists across scenes (I recommend just adding it to the Modules folder under Cozy Weather).
